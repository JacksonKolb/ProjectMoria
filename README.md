# ProjectMoria
Text-based Dungeon/RPG Game


Project Moria is a text-based dungeon/rpg game being developed in Java by Jackson Kolb.  

The game uses a 30x30 array of Room objects, which randomly select different types of Rooms, to create a Dungeon.  Then, each Room is randomly populated with different Monster Objects.  The user may select from two different player types, who have slightly different attributes for battles.  

Player Types

-Warrior - Well balanced, generic warrior build. 

-Duelist - Less armour than the Warrior, but higher chances for critical hits. *DUELIST CLASS HAS 8000 HP FOR ERROR TESTING*
