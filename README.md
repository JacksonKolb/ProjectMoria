# ProjectMoria
A Text-based Dungeon/RPG Game


Project Moria is a text-based dungeon/rpg game being developed in Java by Jackson Kolb.  

  The game uses a 30x30 array of Room objects, which randomly select different types of Rooms, to create a Dungeon.  Then, each Room is randomly populated with different Monster Objects.  The user may select from two different player types, who have slightly different attributes for battles. 
  Players may also use up to 3 potions to heal themselves during battles.  If they choose to heal, they may not attack during the same turn (similiar to pokemon). 


#### Player Types

-Warrior - Well balanced, generic warrior build. 

-Duelist - Less armour than the Warrior, but higher chances for critical hits. *DUELIST CLASS HAS 8000 HP FOR ERROR TESTING*

#### Planned additions to the game include :

-More types of items
  * superPotions
  * critPotions
  * teleportPotions

-Inventory System to hold more items

-Boss battles with better rewards

-Multiple monsters in the same room

-Saving and Loading Games
